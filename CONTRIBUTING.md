# Pull Request Workflow
1. Fork the repository into your own account
2. Set 'upstream' as the master fork
3. Work on a feature you've assigned yourself/been assigned to
4. Commit your code in micro-commits and write a succinct but inclulsive commit message that reflects all the changes you've made
5. Push your branch to your own fork
6. Create a pull request to the team between the master and your fork
7. Have a team member review the code, ask any questions (in person or via slack), and then merge the pull requests if there are no conflicts
8. Rebase your own fork/branch after someone else has merged a pull request

# Code Review Workflow
1. Another team member reviews the pull request and writes code comments if necessary
2. Make any changes if they have been requested
3. Resubmit your pull request until they are no more changes
